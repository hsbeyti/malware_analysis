# VirtualBox Guest Session and Process Monitoring

This project demonstrates how to use Python to interact with a VirtualBox virtual machine (VM) and perform the following tasks:

- Initialize VirtualBox and connect to a Windows VM (`malware_analysis`).
- Create a guest session on the VM using the `VBoxAPI`.
- Execute a batch process on the guest VM (e.g., running `ping` or other commands) via the `cmd.exe` shell.
- Monitor the status of the process, including capturing stdout and stderr.

## Prerequisites

Before you run the project, ensure the following:

1. **VirtualBox** is installed and configured on your system.
2. The **VirtualBox Python API (`vboxapi`)** is available.
3. You have a Windows VM set up in VirtualBox with the name `malware_analysis`.
4. Your VM has a valid username (`hsbeyti`) and password (`12345678`) for authentication.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies (make sure Python is installed):

   ```bash
   pip install vboxapi
   ```

3. Ensure that **VirtualBox** is installed and accessible from the Python script.

## How to Run

To run the project, simply execute the Python script:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

The script will:

1. Initialize VirtualBox and locate the `malware_analysis` machine.
2. Lock the machine and create a guest session.
3. Execute a batch file on the guest VM (the batch file is located at `C:\Users\hsbeyti\tools\execut\bin\run.bat`).
4. Monitor the process status and print the process output (stdout and stderr).
5. The process being run is `ping`, but you can modify this command as necessary.

## Configuration

### Changing the Command

You can modify the `command_to_run` variable inside the script to specify the command that should be run in the VM. The default command is set to `ping`, but you can change it to any valid command you want to execute inside the VM.

```python
command_to_run = "ping"
```

### Batch File Path

Ensure the `run.bat` batch file exists at the following path on the VM:

```bash
C:\Users\hsbeyti\tools\execut\bin\run.bat
```

Modify the script if you wish to run a different batch file or executable.
